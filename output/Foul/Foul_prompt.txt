A 'foul' in sports means doing something that's not allowed by the game's rules, usually to unfairly stop or get an advantage over an opponent. It's like breaking a small rule, for example, by pushing someone, grabbing their clothing, or tripping them, instead of just trying to play the ball fairly.

Here are descriptions for images that illustrate this concept:

1.  **Image 1 Description:** A green playing field with white boundary lines. A blue circle (player) is moving towards a yellow ball (indicated by a dashed arrow). A red square (opponent) is positioned directly in the blue circle's path. A thick, red zigzag line connects the red square to the blue circle, illustrating an illegal obstruction or contact, preventing fair movement to the ball.

2.  **Image 2 Description:** A green playing field with white boundary lines. A purple triangle (player) is attempting to move towards a yellow ball (indicated by a dashed arrow). An orange pentagon (opponent) has extended a curved, red 'holding' line with a hook-like end that connects to and restricts the movement of the purple triangle, illustrating an unfair hold.

3.  **Image 3 Description:** A green playing field with white boundary lines. A green star (player) is moving towards a yellow ball (indicated by a dashed arrow). A cyan diamond (opponent) uses a short, forceful red arrow originating from it to push the green star sideways, diverting its path away from the ball and showing an illegal physical interference.
