Dribbling means gently tapping or pushing a ball repeatedly to keep it close to you while you move. It's like guiding the ball along with you as you walk or run, making sure it stays under your control so you don't lose it to someone else or let it roll too far away.

Here are descriptions for three images illustrating dribbling:

1.  **Image 1: Basic Dribbling Movement**
    A simple green field with a large white circle representing a player's movement path. A single ball is shown along this path, with a dotted line extending from the ball to show its short, repeated movements, indicating the ball is kept close to the moving player (represented by the path). Arrows indicate the general direction of travel.

2.  **Image 2: Dribbling Within a Boundary**
    A rectangular playing area (field outline) with a ball positioned inside. A series of small, curved arrows indicate the ball being repeatedly nudged by an unseen player, moving it in a zigzag path across a small section of the field while remaining within the boundaries. A larger arrow shows the overall direction of the ball's controlled travel.

3.  **Image 3: The Act of Touching and Guiding**
    A close-up, abstract view showing a stylized "foot" shape (no person depicted) positioned next to a ball. A small arrow points from the "foot" to the ball, representing a gentle touch. Immediately next to it, the ball is shown slightly advanced along a dashed line, with another arrow indicating its short, controlled movement after the touch. This sequence is repeated once more to emphasize the 'repeated touches' aspect.
