A Bicycle Kick is an acrobatic kicking move where a player lies in the air, lifts both legs, and kicks the ball *backwards* over their own head. It's a spectacular way to strike the ball behind them, often while falling or airborne.

Here are the image descriptions:

1.  **Image 1: The mid-air setup**
    A simple, elongated, slightly curved shape lies horizontally in the air, representing a player's body during the jump. A small circle (the ball) is positioned in front of and slightly above one end of this shape (the implied 'feet' area). A straight dashed line indicates the ground below. This illustrates the player's aerial position relative to the ball just before the kick.

2.  **Image 2: The backward kick motion**
    The same elongated, curved body shape is shown horizontally in the air. A curved arrow originates from the 'feet' end of the body shape, arches *upwards and backwards* over the body, and points towards the ball, which is now positioned behind the body's implied 'head' end. The ball is slightly further away, showing the direction of the kick. A dashed line indicates the ground below.

3.  **Image 3: The ball's flight path**
    A straight ground line runs across the bottom. A faint, elongated, curved outline represents the player's body at the point of impact, just above the ground line. A strong, curved arrow illustrates the ball's flight path, starting from near the faint body outline and arcing high upwards and backwards across the scene. The small circle (the ball) is shown at the peak of this trajectory.
