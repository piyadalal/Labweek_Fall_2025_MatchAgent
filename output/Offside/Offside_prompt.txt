Minimalistic schematic, top-down view of a solid green football field with a white goal frame on the right, no crowd or stadium. Use simple geometric shapes: dark square (defender) in front of the goal, red triangle (attacker) to the left and further from goal, yellow circle (ball) even further left. A faint, dashed line extends from the defender towards the goal, indicating the offside line. The attacking player is clearly behind this line. High contrast, labeled elements, vector style, no extraneous detail.
