A 'Forward' is a player in a team sport whose main job is to move towards the opponent's goal and try to score points or goals. They are usually positioned closer to the opposing team's scoring area than their own team's goal, focusing on attacking and creating scoring chances.

Here are descriptions for images that illustrate this concept:

**Image 1 Description:**
A simple green field with two distinct goal areas at opposite ends, marked by white rectangular posts. A single blue circular player shape (representing a 'Forward') is positioned in the half of the field closer to one of the goals. A small white circle (the ball) is placed in front of the blue player. A white dashed arrow points from the blue player and the ball towards the goal, illustrating their primary attacking direction.

**Image 2 Description:**
A close-up view of the attacking zone of a field. A blue circular player shape (the 'Forward') is positioned centrally, facing a red rectangular goal. A white ball is at the 'Forward's' position. A long, straight white arrow extends from the ball directly towards the center of the goal, depicting a clear shot attempt. The area around the goal is clearly visible.

**Image 3 Description:**
A section of a playing field showing movement. A blue circular player shape (the 'Forward') is shown with a white ball slightly ahead, indicating control. A curved white arrow traces the path of the player and ball, moving them progressively closer to a distant red rectangular goal, which is visible at the end of the path. This illustrates the Forward's role in advancing the ball into scoring position.
