A 'Hat-Trick' in sports refers to a special achievement when one player successfully completes a specific excellent feat three times during a single game or match. For example, in soccer, it means a single player scores three goals in that one game.

Here are descriptions for images illustrating this concept:

1.  **Image 1: First Goal**
    A simplified green playing field with a white rectangular goal frame at one end. A single, distinctively colored player marker (e.g., a blue circle) is positioned on the field. A white soccer ball is shown inside the goal, with a dashed arrow indicating its path from the player marker into the net, representing the first goal.

2.  **Image 2: Second Goal**
    On the same green playing field, the goal frame now clearly contains two white soccer balls. The distinct blue circular player marker is still present. A second dashed arrow shows the path of another ball from the player marker into the goal, illustrating the second goal scored by the same player.

3.  **Image 3: Third Goal (Hat-Trick Achieved)**
    The same green playing field shows the goal frame now containing three white soccer balls. The distinct blue circular player marker is clearly visible. A third dashed arrow points from the player marker to the third ball in the net, visually representing the completion of three goals scored by one player within the single game.
