A 'set piece' in sports refers to a planned play that occurs after the game has temporarily stopped for a specific reason, like a foul or the ball going out of bounds. Instead of just resuming normal play, one team gets a special, strategic restart – such as a free kick from a specific spot or a corner kick from the corner of the field – to try and gain an advantage.

Here are image descriptions to illustrate the concept:

1.  A green field with a central circular zone and a rectangular goal area on one side. A small red circle marks the ball's position near the center, representing a stoppage due to a foul. Three blue triangular shapes (attacking players) are positioned near the ball, while five red square shapes (defending players) form a line in front of the goal area, illustrating a planned free kick setup. Dashed lines from the ball show potential passing trajectories.

2.  A segment of a sports field showing a corner arc and the adjacent penalty box lines. A small red circle (the ball) is placed within the corner arc, near a simple flag shape. Three blue triangular shapes (attacking players) are positioned around the penalty box, with two near the ball and one closer to the goal. Five red square shapes (defending players) are strategically placed within the penalty box near the goal, indicating defensive positioning during a corner kick. Arrows from the ball show a curved trajectory into the penalty box, demonstrating a planned play.

3.  A section of a field displaying the penalty box and goal lines. A small red circle (the ball) is placed just outside the penalty box. A line of four red square shapes (defending players) forms a 'wall' between the ball and the goal. Three blue triangular shapes (attacking players) are positioned near the ball, indicating a strategic free-kick setup aiming towards the goal. A curved arrow from the ball illustrates a potential shot path over the defensive 'wall' towards the goal, highlighting a pre-planned offensive move.
