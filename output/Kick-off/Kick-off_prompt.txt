A **Kick-off** is the special way a game starts or restarts in sports like soccer. It always takes place from the exact center of the playing field. A player kicks the ball from this central spot to get the game officially underway at the beginning of a half or after a goal has been scored.

Here are the descriptions for three images illustrating the concept:

1.  **Image 1: Kick-off Setup**
    A green playing field is visible with a prominent center circle and a clear center spot. The ball rests precisely on the center spot, with a simple player figure positioned next to it, ready to kick. Other player figures are shown spread out across both halves of the field, remaining behind the halfway line until the kick occurs.

2.  **Image 2: The Kick in Action**
    The scene shows the ball just after it has been kicked from the center spot, indicated by a short, dashed arrow showing its initial forward movement. The player figure who kicked the ball is depicted in a follow-through motion, while other player figures on the field remain in their starting positions, awaiting the ball to be in play.

3.  **Image 3: Ball in Play**
    The ball is now shown further down the field from the center spot, indicated by a longer arrow, signifying it's actively moving. Player figures from both teams are no longer in static starting positions but are depicted in various states of movement, responding to the kicked ball as the game has officially begun.
