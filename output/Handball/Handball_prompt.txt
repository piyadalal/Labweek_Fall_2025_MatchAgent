In games like soccer, 'handball' is a rule violation. It means a player intentionally touches the ball with their hand or arm when they shouldn't. This is considered an unfair advantage because these types of sports are usually played using feet or other parts of the body.

Here are descriptions for images illustrating this concept:

1.  **Image 1: The Act of Handball**
    A simple green field with a white sideline. An abstract player figure, represented by a simple upright rectangle with two limb-like extensions, is shown. One limb, representing an arm, is extended and making direct contact with a soccer ball. A red 'X' symbol is overlaid on the point of contact between the arm and the ball, clearly indicating a prohibited action.

2.  **Image 2: The Forbidden Body Zones**
    An abstract, simplified human-like figure stands centrally on a plain background. Its arm and hand areas, from the shoulder down, are distinctly highlighted with a contrasting color (e.g., red or crosshatching), clearly marking the zones where touching the ball constitutes a handball offense. A soccer ball is placed near the figure's feet, emphasizing that it's a foot-based game.

3.  **Image 3: Ball Path Interruption**
    A simple green field shows a soccer ball moving along a dashed line, indicating its original trajectory. An abstract player figure (simple shape) is positioned on this line, with an arm extended to intercept the ball. Another dashed line, indicating the ball's new, altered trajectory after illegally hitting the player's arm (which has a small red 'X' indicating the foul), diverges sharply from the original path.
