The 'Advantage Rule' means that if a team commits a minor rule-breaking action (a foul) but the team that was fouled is in a better position to score or continue a good attack, the official will let play continue instead of stopping the game immediately. It's like saying, "Yes, there was a foul, but you're doing so well right now, keep going!" This prevents the fouling team from benefiting by disrupting a dangerous attack.

Here are descriptions for three images illustrating this concept:

1.  **Image 1 Description:** A blue player shape is moving with a ball towards a goal area. A red player shape makes a minor obstructive action (indicated by small, short dashed lines near the blue player), which would normally be a foul. However, the blue player maintains control of the ball and continues moving forward with momentum towards the goal, indicated by a strong arrow.

2.  **Image 2 Description:** In the same scene, an official's arm shape (positioned outside the main play area) is extended forward, signaling 'advantage' with a clear, open palm gesture. The dashed lines indicating the foul are still present but are now overshadowed by a bold green arrow showing the blue player's uninterrupted, rapid movement with the ball towards the goal area. The red player is no longer obstructing.

3.  **Image 3 Description:** The blue player successfully continues their advance, bringing the ball deep into the goal area. A large, clear arrow points from the blue player with the ball into the scoring zone, illustrating the successful outcome of allowing play to continue after the foul. The red player is shown further away, unable to intervene.
