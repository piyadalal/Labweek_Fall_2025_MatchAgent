Imagine a large rectangular area marked on a soccer field directly in front of each goal. This area is called the 'Penalty Area,' or sometimes the '18-yard box.' It's a very important zone because only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball with their hands within these boundaries. Also, if a player on the defending team commits certain serious fouls inside this box, the other team is awarded a special direct shot at the goal called a 'penalty kick.'

Here are descriptions for images that illustrate the concept:

1.  **Image Description:** An aerial view of a green soccer field showing a goal and a distinct, large rectangular box drawn in front of it with white lines. The box clearly outlines the 'Penalty Area' on the field.
2.  **Image Description:** A close-up view of the 'Penalty Area' showing the goal and the rectangular boundary. Inside the box, a soccer ball is depicted, with a simplified open hand shape next to it, indicating that handling is permitted here. Outside the box, another soccer ball has a 'no' symbol (a circle with a diagonal line) over a similar hand shape, showing that handling is not allowed elsewhere.
3.  **Image Description:** A detailed view of the 'Penalty Area' focusing on the distinct small circular mark known as the 'penalty spot' located inside the box, directly in front of the goal. A soccer ball is placed on this spot, with a bold arrow pointing from the ball directly towards the center of the goal, illustrating the direction of a penalty kick.
