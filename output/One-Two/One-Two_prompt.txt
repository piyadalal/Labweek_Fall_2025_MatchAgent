A "One-Two" is a quick and effective passing move between two teammates. Imagine Player A passes the ball to Player B (this is the "one"), and then immediately runs into open space. Player B quickly passes the ball back to Player A (this is the "two"), allowing them to bypass opponents and advance the ball together.

Here are the image descriptions to illustrate the concept:

1.  **Image 1 Description:** A simple diagram on a neutral background. Two large circular shapes, one on the left (representing Player A) and one on the right (representing Player B), are positioned within a rectangular playing area defined by thin lines. A small solid sphere (the ball) is shown mid-air, with a solid arrow indicating its path directly from Player A towards Player B.

2.  **Image 2 Description:** A continuation of the diagram. The circular Player B now has the small solid sphere (the ball) positioned next to it. The circular Player A has moved forward and to the right, indicated by a dashed line showing its path from its previous position. A vertical dashed line acts as a simple barrier or defensive line that Player A is now moving past.

3.  **Image 3 Description:** The final step in the diagram sequence. The circular Player B is shown passing the small solid sphere (the ball) back towards the circular Player A, which is now in an advanced position past the vertical dashed defensive line. A solid arrow indicates the return pass from Player B to Player A. The ball is shown arriving at Player A, completing the quick exchange.
